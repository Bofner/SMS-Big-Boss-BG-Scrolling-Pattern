# SMS-Big-Boss-BG-Scrolling-Pattern
I was playing around with how to get a big boss with a dynamic background on the SMS. I ended up using the Electric Fan sprite from Darius gaiden for the boss. 
The background is made up of one color that changes every couple of pixels using the horizontal blanking interval.
